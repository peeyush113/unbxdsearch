this is a small search engine for movies provided in the form of csv file. 
i m using slim framework and php redbean for making mysql queries.
you can import the csv file data as in mysql by running the sql file.
in the sql query i m taking the csv file as 'movies.txt' change the file accordingly. 
you can run the sql using commands below 

$mysql -u root -p --local-infile
mysql> source database.sql

for slim to work properly you will need to enable rewrite.
