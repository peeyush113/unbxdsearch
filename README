This is a small search engine for movies provided in the form of csv file. 

I am using slim framework and php redbean for making mysql queries.
You can import the csv file data as in mysql by running the sql file.
In the sql query i m taking the csv file as 'movies.txt' change it accordingly. 
You can run the sql using commands below 

$mysql -u root -p --local-infile
mysql> source database.sql

For slim to work properly you will need to enable rewrite.
I have already added .htaccess file in directory so you will have enable using .htaccess file.
You might need to change AllowOverride None to AllowOverride FileInfo for your virtual host.
